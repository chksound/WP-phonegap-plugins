I developed this plugin for phonegap on Windows Phone 8.  Windows Phone 8 Outshines the Android and iOS when it comes to speech capabilities.

Sure SIRI is nice but there is no interface API to use that and also it needs a data connection.

With custom grammars (SRGS) you can use the excellent offline speech capabilities of the WP phones. (Not sure if this works as is on the WP7 phones.)

More detail information is found here.
